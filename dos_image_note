entrypoint = 0x200 + (cs << 4) + ip
0x200 is header size * 0x10
ds:dx = 12:34 is 0x200 + 0x120 + 0x34 
relocated segment = segment + runtime relocation offset
segment = 0 is 0x200 in binary
relocated entry = address of byte. This byte += runtime relocation offset when loading image
psp_seg = start_seg - 0x10
